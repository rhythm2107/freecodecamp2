## FreeCodeCamp - Scientific Computing with Python
This is a repository with all projects that I created by coding along with FreeCodeCamp's intermediate Python course. This course is fully **practical** and **interactive**, giving hints but not answers, forcing you to **do your own research** and find the correct approach & solution. You can check their course [-here-](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/).

The course will require you to create **15 projects**, each of which focus on different concept *(check list below)*.

Ten projects with hints on what concepts to use:
1. Vighenere Cipher using **String Manipulation** *(My attempt: [1](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/password_generator.py))*.
2. Credit Card Verified using **Luhn Algorithm** *(My attempt: [1](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/luhn_algorithm_mine.py), [2](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/luhn_algorithm_fcc.py))*
3. Expense Tracker with **Lambda Functions** *(My attempt: [1](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/expense_tracker.py))*
4. Case Converter Program with **List Comprehension** *(My attempt: [1](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/case_converter.py))*
5. Password Generator using **Regular Expressions** *(My attempt: [1](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/password_generator.py))*
6. Shortest Path Algorithm using **Djikstra's Algorithm** and **Graphs Data Structure** *(My attempt: [1](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/algorithm_design.py))*
7. Tower of Hanoi using **Recursion** *(My attempt: [1](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/tower_of_hanoi_iterative.py), [2](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/tower_of_hanoi_recursive.py))*
8. Merge Sort Algorithm using **Recursion** *(My attempt: [1](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/merge_sort_algo.py))*
9. Sudoku Solver using **Object Oriented Programming** *(My attempt: [1](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/sudoku_solver.py))*
10. Tree Traversal using **Binary Search Tree** *(My attempt: [1](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/tree_traversal.py))*

And five projects without any hints:
1. Arithmetic Formatter
2. Time Calculator
3. Budget App
4. Polygon Area Calculator
5. Probability Calculator
