## FreeCodeCamp - Scientific Computing with Python
This is a repository with all projects that I created by coding along with FreeCodeCamp's intermediate Python course. This course is fully **practical** and **interactive**, giving hints but not answers, forcing you to **do your own research** and find the correct approach & solution. You can check their course [-here-](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/).

The course will require you to create **15 projects**, each of which focus on different concept *(check list below)*.

1. Building a Vighenere Cipher using String Manipulation *(My attempt: [1](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/password_generator.py))*.
2. Building a Credit Card Verified using Luhn Algorithm *(My attempt: [1](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/luhn_algorithm_mine.py), [2](https://github.com/rhythm2107/freecodecamp2/blob/main/luhn_algorithm_fcc.py))
