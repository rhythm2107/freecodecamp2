## FreeCodeCamp - Scientific Computing with Python
This is a repository with all projects that I created by coding along with FreeCodeCamp's intermediate Python course. This course is fully <span style='color:orange;'>**practical**</span> and <span style='color:orange;'>**interactive**</span>, giving hints but not answers, forcing you to **do your own research** and find the correct approach & solution. It's a great way to practice multitude of concepts _(check table below)._

You can check their course [-here-](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)
A very <span style='color: orange;'>**practical**</span> sentence.
